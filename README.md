## Part 1-Pluralsight Angular: Getting Started by Deborah Kurata

Angular patterns for components, modules, patterns and services->
- Components, 
- Templates, Data binding and directives, 
- Services and dependency injection,
- Http and observables
- Navigation and routing
- Angular CLI to generate, execute and test 

Angular makes HTML expressive, contains data binding, promotes mmodularity, and buil-in support to communicate iwht back end.

AngularJS->speed (faster initial load, hange detection and rendering), modern (classes, modules, directives), simplified (easier to learn, simple binding), productivity 

### Module- First things first-
#### Anatomy of an app
- Set of components (comprised of templates)
    - Template (HTML)
    - Class (Code associated with the view)
        - Properties
        - Methods
    - Metadata
- Services across the components

Angular modules - At least one root that consolidate the components together
